# Boston OpenStreetMap Analysis
Analysis of [Boston OpenStreetMap data](https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/boston_massachusetts/) to explore and curate the Boston Open Street Map:
1. Problems encountered in the map:
  * Audit type of tags
  * Audit street names
  * Audit postal codes
  * Audit 'tourism' tags
2. Overview of data:
  * Size of the files
  * Number of nodes and ways
  * Number of unique users
  * Top 10 contributing users
  * Top 10 tourism types
  * Top 10 values and counts in leisure tags and tourism tags that the top contributor had curated
  * Maximum number of nodes required for way elements with the top 10 tourism tags
3. Other ideas about the dataset:
  * More on curating the street names -- street number in front of the street name
  * Looking at 'addr:street' audit as a case study for the Boston OSM quality
  * Looking at 'museum' tags as a case study for the Boston OSM quality

All Python codes used for the project are also included in the folder along with the report for the analysis.
## Learning objectives

* Python
* SQL
* data wrangling

## Getting started
